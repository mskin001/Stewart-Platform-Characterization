Signal Names:
Data and variables beginning with "h2c" or "host" are signals sent to
LAMP from the host. This is what we (the operators) are asking LAMP to
do. Data and variables beginning with "c2h" or "control" or "cont" 
are signals coming back from LAMP to us. This is the response, what
LAMP is actually doing.
